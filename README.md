This app was also made possible because of the talented engineer who created the <a href="https://gadhagod.github.io/Hyrule-Compendium-API/#/">Hyrule Compendium API</a> This API provides an assortmant of over 300 possible images to play around with in the APP. Zelda Dunegeon has also been a great asset with providing some of the other assets to bring this app together.
